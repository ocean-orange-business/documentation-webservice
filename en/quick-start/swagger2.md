# Swagger

### Quick Start

## 1. Authenticate

Before accessing any service, an authentication phase is required at the following link:

```
/restapi/auth/authenticate2
-> https://v3.oceansystem.com/ocean/restapi/common/openapi/explorer?onlyPubliclyDocumented=true&usePathInNavBar=false&renderStyle=read#?route=post-/auth/authenticate2
```

**It is possible to test authentication directly on Swagger:**
https://v3.oceansystem.com/ocean/restapi/common/openapi/explorer?onlyPubliclyDocumented=true&usePathInNavBar=false&renderStyle=read#?route=auth

![create_file.png](/contributing_img/create_file.png)

To authenticate, simply:

1. Expand the link,
2. Click on the "Try it out" button in the top right corner,
3. Enter your login/password in the "body" field as follows:

![connexion_new_swagger.png](/contributing_img/connexion_new_swagger.png)
**Example in the json** 
```JSON
{"login":"myLogin","password":"password123!"}
```

Then, to validate the authentication, click on the "Execute" button at the bottom of the screen.

Once authentication is successful, the following screen appears:

The parts to consider are:

- **Curl**: allows you to execute the service directly using the console without going through the web interface.
- **Response body**: contains the token generated during the invocation of this service, which can also be generated using the command above.

## 2. Add the "Modify Header" Extension

*To test from your browser*

This section explains how to use the generated token to continue using our web services from a browser.  
First, you need to download a "Modify Header" extension for your browser.  
(For our example, we will use the Firefox browser, and the download link is: https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/modify-headers/)  
To verify that the plugin has been added to the browser, this icon should appear in the top right corner of the browser.

Once the extension is added, click on "Open Modify Headers" and enter the following information:

1. **X-Auth-Token**
2. The token retrieved previously.

*Note: After entering these parameters for the first time, each time you authenticate or after the token expires, you need to generate a new token by reconnecting and modifying the header, then clicking on "Edit".*

## 3. Build a Request

A request to the REST API includes the basic element shown in the table below and may also contain specific parameters:

| Element | Example/Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Base URL** | https://v3.oceansystem.com/ocean-3.0.0/apidocs | Production environment |
| **Specific URL (extension of the base URL)** | /restapi/materiel |  |
| **Resource** | /list/positionBetween | Specify request details via query parameters |
| **Format** | Supported formats: â€¢ JSON |  |
| **Token** | &token={token} | Replace with your unique token |
